# 5.8 Cryptography and Key Management
## Objective
Making sure effective cryptography techniques is used to protect information
## KRY-01 Policy for the user of encryption procedures and key management
### Requirement:
Basically  encryption procedures and key  management should be documented according to SA-01. Follwing aspects should be described:
Strong encryption methods and secure network protocols should be used and mentioned, BSI TR-02102-1 to BSI TR-02102-4 should mention recommendation
Risk based regulations should be made clear
Requirements for  storage, archiving, retrieving, distribution and deletion of key
Taking legalities and regulations into consideration

## KRY-02 Encryption of data for transmission (transport encryption)
### Requirement:
Establishing procedures and technical safeguards for strong encryption and authentication for transmission of data of your cloud customers
Currently BSI technical guideline TR-02102-2 that talks about TLS/SSL.
Description of additional requirements (Confidentiality)
If data that has higher protection req. , strong encryption must be implemented within the infrastructure.

## KRY-03 Encryption of sensitive data for storage
### Requirement:
Sensitive data that is stored within our data centers should be encrypted.

## KRY-04 Secure key management
### Requirement:
Technical safeguards for secure key management include:
Generation of keys for different cryptographic systems and applications
Issuing and obtaining public key certficiates
Provisioning and activation of the keys for customers and 3 parties that might be involved
Secure storage of own keys (companyâ€™s keys, not customers)
Handling compromised keys appropiately
withdrawl/deletion of keys (if for example an employee leaves the company)
Storage of the keys of the cloud users

# 2.2.1 Infosec & Sec Goals

ISKE uses the usual:

### Availability
Data should be easily accessible at the required/necessary moment and within the required time period. if availability is lost, the entire information system is useless
### Integirty
Data should be correct and complete/up to date, with authentic origin.
### Confidentiality
Data should only maintain availability within the scope of the authorise persons.

No information system is entirely secure (available, confidential, and integral).
All 3 components should be taken consideration of, but given different weights according to the purpose/use case of the information system.

Data security means that the 3 goals: info avail. (K), Info Integ. (T), Info Conf. (S) have been met.

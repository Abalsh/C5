# 5.7 Identity and Access Management
## Objective
Securing authorisation/authentication of cloud provider users and cloud customers to prevent unathurised access
## IDM-01 Policy for system and data access 
### Requirements:
Documentation that is compliant to SA-01 is required.
Documentation should be about the policy of the cloud provider in terms of roles and rights of access in contrast to security requirements, it should mention:
Granting and changing of data carried on the basis of “least-privilege principle” and as is necessary (“need to know ” principle)
Separation of duties
Regular review of granted authorisation
Withdraw of authorisation
Requirements for approval and documentation of the management of system and data access authorisation 
## IDM-02 User registration
### Requirement:
Organisational and/or technical  safeguards must be implemented in order to make sure there are unique user IDs and formal user granting procedures that clearly identifies these unique IDs.
### Description of additional requirements (confidentiality)
Self-service option for cloud customers to grant their user IDs independently 

## IDM-03 Granting and provisioning of data access authorisations
### Requirement:
Data access should be authorised based on “least privilege” and “need to know” principles along with a formal approval from an authorised person(s).
## IDM-04 Withdrawal of authorisation in case of changes to the employment relationship
### Requirement:
Cloud provider needs to withdraw/change data access to employees if they left or changed team with 30 day cap limit, any access should be deactivated completely as soon as employee leaves.
## IDM-05 Regular review of data access authorisations
### Requirement:
At least once a year, a review of data access authorisation policy should be carried out.
Data access should be reviewed immediately for staff change.
Review is done by an authorised person(s)
### Additional Requirements Description (Confidentiality):
Administrative authorisations should be review at least once every 6 months
## IDM-06 Administrator authorisation
### Requirements:
Granting/Changing data access for users with administrative authorisation must comply with the policy set in IDM-01, and as such the safeguards that achieve “need to know” principle needs to be properly enforced in order to avoid undesired combinations that violate the separation of concerns principle.
If that is not possible, compensating controls such as logging and monitoring by SIEM is sufficient to identify misusage.
## IDM-07 Non-disclosure of authentication information
### Requirement:
Secret authentication credentials should be assigned only temporarily (meaning the user has to change it) for no more than 14 days, users must be forced to change it when using the service for the first time.

Accessing the cloud customer’s authentication credentials must be strictly regulated and communicated with the cloud customers and only performed if absolutely needed. Access must be documented.

### Additional Requirements Description (Confidentiality)
Users sign a declaration that assures the confidentiality/privacy of information.
## IDM-08 Secure login methods
### Requirement:
Confidentiality of login information should be protected by:
Identity check by trusted procedures
Use of recognized industry standards for the authentication and authorisation like automatic expiry, multi factor authentication
## IDM-09 Handling of emergency users
### Requirement:
Use of emergency users should be used only when needed and should be approved by an authorised person which takes the principle of seperation of functions into account (Approval can be granted subsequently provided there is justification). Emergency users must stay active only as long as the necessary tasks are pending.
### Additional Requirements (Confidentiality)
At least once a month, history of activation of emergency users and approvals from authorised person should be reviewed, irregularities must be examined to determine possibility of misuse.
Logging the activities of emergency users in an audit-proof manner so that a 3rd party can comprehend the activities.


## IDM-10 System-side access control
### Requirement:
Technical safeguards should limit access to information based on roles and rights defined in IDM-01.

## IDM-11 Password requirements and validation parameters 
### Requirement:
Security parameters on the network, OS, DB, and app level  should be configured appropriately to avoid unathorised access.
The following is required
Minimum password length of 8 passwords
At least 2 character types of the following: capital letters, small letters, special characters, and numbers
Maximum validity of 90 days. Minimum is 1 day
Password history of 6
Transmission and storage of passwords is encrypted that conforms to working techniques.
For example, security parameters can include those specified in IDM-08 , lock after failed login attempts, automatic logout after inactivity 
### Additional description requirements (Confidentiality)
Automated controls should be implemented, based on the following:
Lock of 15 mins after 5 failed logins , wait time increases by each failed attempt
Multiple logins of one and the same user are not possible
Upon login, logout after 15 minutes of inactivity
Privileged users minimum pass length is 14 char, 8 char for users
After 90 days, user has to change pass with next login
Password history is 12
## IDM-12 Restriction and control of administrative software
### Requirements:
Access to administrative software should be locked down heavily to the roles which are clearly defined in IDM-01. 
Integrating strong authentication techniques such as multi-factor authentication is required (KOS-06).
IDM-13 Control of access to source code
Requirement:
Access to the source code that is directly related to the cloud service should be granted restrictively and monitored to prevent unauthorised access and unattended changes
